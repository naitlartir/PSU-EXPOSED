IF NEEDED I WILL UPDATE THIS GITHUB (open readme.md)

If you didnt know yet, I got banned for apparently "nuking" the new PSU server. Ofcourse that is false I did ALOT for PSU such as let lorress (lorress is bitwise btw) sit on my pc coding for hours using anydesk (he cant on his as VS2019 doesnt install for some reason). To clarify he is a russian and so is his friend. He gave his friend the code to my anydesk so they could rat my pc. (Install a trojan). His official discord is Lorress#0541 and Bitwise#4908 the gay friend is S.mode#9723. It left me sad thinking bitwise just boom betrayed me for a russian dumbass and making a excuse. Extreme thanks to a bunch of people supporting me, getting themselves falsely banned for "supporting racism" (i have proof bitwise is a racist aswell). There is too much to explain so check the folders in the github or whatever its called for more info and special thanks you the following people:
