Multiple people dming me saying "how do i run this" "i got a problem" etc etc. This tutorial will explain it.


JUST REALSIED CHANGING THE TOKEN WONT WORK YOU GOTTA EDIT THE ACTUAL CODE SORRY ðŸ’€



BUILT VERSION:
1. Open the folders till you find all the files. Find token.txt replace it with yours and run the exe called bot-dotnet.exe.
2. Now if the cmd prompt closes that means your missing dotnet packages (used in C# etc coding),
3. You may download the working ones at https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/sdk-3.1.418-windows-x64-installer
4. If it still does not work then dm my main ezz#0101 but I do not fully know what else you could do.
5. Run the exe again and it should work perfectly. If your someone whos gonna log scripts its located in Storage/Obfuscations/all the folders.
6. Enjoy? You can fork this or whatever lol change token for your own.



Source Version:
